#CONCLUSION
#It was realized that the higher the age, the lower the time that was spent on the site.
#There were no outliers in the data which made it easier for analysis
#The range in age of people who visited the site was between 19 an 61 years
```
```r
#Recomendation
# More focus should be emphasized on the young people compared to the older people
